            Oops! Seems that the connection with the server
            has been lost. This is normally due to lost or
            poor network connections.
        </p>
        <p>
            Please hang on a while while we try to reconnect...
        </p>
    </ReconnectingTemplate>
    <ReconnectFailedTemplate>
        <p>
            We're sorry, but the reconnection attempts failed.
        </p>
        <p>
            You can now either try to
            <a href="javascript:window.Blazor.reconnect()">reconnect</a>
            or just <a href="javascript:location.reload()">reload</a>
            the page.
        </p>
        <p>
            Be prepared that reloading will not work, since failure to
            reconnect usually is due to a longer network failure or
            the server has been taken down for maintenance.
        </p>
    </ReconnectFailedTemplate>
    <ReconnectRejectedTemplate>
        <p>
            The connection attempts have all been rejected by
            the server. This is often caused by a fault on the server.
        </p>
        <p>
            You can try to
            <a href="javascript:location.reload()">reload</a>
            the page, but please note that this will likely not
            succeed due to the likely failure on the server.
        </p>
