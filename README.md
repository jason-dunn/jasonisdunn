.Net 5.0 Blazor Server App

Working example on http://jasonisdunn.tech/session


A realistic example of demostrating Blazored Session Storage. This application utilizes a real register/login process using a live SMTP email service.
The sample generic fetchdata and counter razor components have been modified to preserve the data per user session.
It's just a lot of fun!
